# messanger_dotnet_group_5

It was supposed to be a simplified clone of Slack. I was working on it with a team in a Scrum-based pipeline for my .NET Bootcamp. I was responsible for implementing the console interface and the functionality for rooms.

# What I Learned

- How to work in a Scrum-based pipeline.
- How to present increments, made during a Sprint, to code reviewers.
- How to design a better n-layered architecture.
- How to write asynchronous code better.
